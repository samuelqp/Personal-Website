    <p id="about-me">
        Welcome to my website! I am currently a second-year student at the University of Waterloo pursuing a major
      in Physics and a minor in Computing. Originally from Mississauga, Ontario, I've always had a fascination with
      physics, programming, and electronics.<br><br>

      My most recent employment was for the department of Electrical and Computer
      Engineering of the University of Waterloo as a Computer Support Assistant. In this
      role I mostly troubleshooted and repaired computers that were having hardware issues
      as well as deploying new computers to faculty and research positions, with any
      necessary software. A highlight for me during this job was when I was
      tasked to deploy ~20 Pynq FPGA development boards running Linux for a lab. I
      noticed that the deployment process was repetitive so I wrote a Bash script that
      automated everything and that I could remotely run on the boards, which
      significantly decreased the time it took to set up the lab course.
