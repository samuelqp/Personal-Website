    <p id="about-me">
        Welcome to my website! I am currently a third-year student at the University of Waterloo pursuing a major
      in Physics and a minor in Computing. Originally from Mississauga, Ontario, I've always had a fascination with
      physics, programming, and electronics.
      <br><br>
      When I am not studying or working, I am usually listening to music and obsessing
      over the side project I am currently working on (right now its this <a
        href="https://github.com/samuelqp/SQPWatch" 
        target="_blank" 
        rel="noopener noreferrer">smart watch</a> project). Some of my hobbies are playing
      guitar, skateboarding, and playing poker with friends.
      <br><br>
      I am currently working as a research assistant at SNOLAB on the <a
        href="https://deap3600.ca/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener norefferrer">DEAP-3600</a> experiment; a dark matter detector
      that uses liquid argon as the target material, being one of the most sensitive
      detectors to WIMP nucleon elastic scattering. I am upgrading hardware on the
      detector, including the recommissioning of the detector, as well as taking data and
      doing data analysis.
      <br><br>
      My most recent employment before this was for the department of Electrical and Computer
      Engineering of the University of Waterloo as a Computer Support Assistant. In this
      role I mostly troubleshooted and repaired computers that were having hardware issues
      as well as deploying new computers to faculty and research positions, with any
      necessary software installed. A highlight for me during this job was when I was
      tasked to deploy ~20 Pynq FPGA development boards running Linux for a lab. I
      noticed that the deployment process was repetitive so I wrote a Bash script that
      automated the process and that I could remotely run on the boards, which
      significantly decreased the time it took to set up the lab course.
