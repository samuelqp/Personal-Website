    <p id="about-me">
        Welcome to my website! I am currently a third-year student at the University of Waterloo pursuing a major
      in Physics and a minor in Computing. Originally from Mississauga, Ontario, I've always had a fascination with
      physics, programming, and electronics.
      <br><br>
      When I am not studying or working, I am usually listening to music and obsessing
      over whatever project I am currently working on (right now its this <a
        href="https://github.com/samuelqp/SQPWatch" 
        target="_blank" 
        rel="noopener noreferrer">smart watch</a> project). Some of my hobbies are playing
      guitar, skateboarding, and playing poker with friends.
      <br><br>

      I am currently working as Undergraduate Researcher at the Institute for Quantum
      Computing for Bradley Hauer's <a
        href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/research/groups/quantum-cavity-optomechanics-qcom-group"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener norefferrer">Quantum Cavity Optomechanics (QCOM) Group</a>,
       where I'm researching optimal states to initialize an optomechanical system with
       the goal of generating a cat state faster or with better fidelity, based on the methods described in 
       <a
        href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.213604?__cf_chl_tk=u8Lz_TQiZYGY_UT6KaSvCLvJBnlI3w5uE3ad3oSfZnI-1762453088-1.0.1.1-FIkOSW9TsoObJN_Rd_6RBNxmEbu0rkzg9As.u2yYQak"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener norefferrer">Nonlinear Sideband Cooling to a Cat State of Motion</a>.

      <br><br>

      My previous co-op was as a research assistant at SNOLAB on the <a
        href="https://deap3600.ca/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener norefferrer">DEAP-3600</a> experiment; a dark matter detector
      that uses liquid argon as the target material, being one of the most sensitive
      detectors to WIMP nucleon elastic scattering. I upgraded hardware on the
      detector, including the recommissioning of the detector, as well as taking data and
      doing data analysis - specifically ensuring the quality of the liquid argon using
      data taken over a 5 year period.

      <br><br>

      Before SNOLAB I worked for the department of Electrical and Computer
      Engineering of the University of Waterloo as a Computer Support Assistant. In this
      role I mostly troubleshooted and repaired computers that were having hardware issues
      as well as deploying new computers to faculty and research positions, with any
      necessary software installed. A highlight for me during this job was when I was
      tasked to deploy ~20 Pynq FPGA development boards running Linux for a lab. I
      noticed that the deployment process was repetitive so I wrote a Bash script that
      automated the process and that I could remotely run on the boards, which
      significantly decreased the time it took to set up the lab course.
